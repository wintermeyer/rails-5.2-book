[[ruby-basics]]
= Ruby Introduction

This chapter is a tightrope walk between oversimplification and a degree of
detail that is unnecessary for a Rails newbie. After all, the objective is not
becoming a Ruby guru, but understanding Ruby on Rails. I am going to elaborate
on the most important points. The rest is then up to you. If you would like to
know more about Ruby, then I recommend the book "The Ruby Programming Language"
by David Flanagan and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto[Yukihiro
Matsumoto].

[quote, Yukihiro Matsumoto]
It is easy to program in Ruby, but Ruby is not a simple language.

[[ruby-version]]
== Ruby 2.4

We are going to use Ruby 2.4. You can check the installed Ruby version
by running the command `ruby -v`:

[source,bash]
$ ruby -v
ruby 2.4.0p0 (2016-12-24 revision 57164) [x86_64-darwin16]
$

[[chapter1-basics]]
== Basics

Ruby is a scripting language. So it is not compiled and then executed,
but read by an interpreter and then processed line by line.

[[hello-world]]
=== Hello World

A simple `hello-world.rb` program consists of one line of code:

[source,ruby]
.hello-world.rb
----
puts 'Hello World!'
----

Use your favorite editor to open a new file with the filename
`hello-world.rb` and insert the above line into it. You can then execute
this Ruby program in the command line as follows:

[source,bash]
----
$ ruby hello-world.rb
Hello World!
$
----

NOTE: A program line in a Ruby program does not have to end with a semicolon.
      The Ruby interpreter is even so intelligent that it recognizes if a
      program line was split over two or more lines for the sake of
      readability. Indenting code is also not necessary. But it does make it
      much easier to read for human beings!

[[puts-and-print]]
=== puts and print

If you go looking for examples on Ruby on the Internet, you will find
two typical ways of printing text on the screen:

* `puts` prints a string, followed by a newline.
* `print` prints a string (without newline).

Example program (an extension of the program `hello-world.rb`):

[source,ruby]
.hello-world.rb
----
puts 'Hello World!'
puts
puts 'zzz'
print 'Hello World!'
print
puts 'zzz'
----

On the screen, you will see this:

[source,bash]
----
$ ruby hello-world.rb
Hello World!

zzz
Hello World!zzz
----

[[comments]]
=== Comments

A comment in a Ruby program starts with a `#`-sign and ends with a
newline. As an example, I can add a comment to the `hello-world.rb`
above:

[source,ruby]
.hello-world.rb
----
# Program for displaying "Hello World!"
# by Stefan Wintermeyer

puts 'Hello World!'
----

A comment can also follow a program line:

[source,ruby]
.hello-world.rb
----
puts 'Hello World!'  # Example comment
----

A `#`-sign within strings in inverted commas is not treated as the start
of a comment. Example program:

[source,ruby]
.hello-world.rb
----
# Example program
# by Stefan Wintermeyer

puts 'Hello World!'
puts '############'
puts
puts '1#2#3#4#5#6#'  # Comment on this
----

[[help-via-ri]]
=== Help via ri

When programming, you do not always have a Ruby handbook available.
Fortunately, the Ruby developers thought of this and provided a built-in
help feature in form of the program `ri`.

NOTE: Of course only if you have installed the documentation which is
      the default. If you used `rvm` to install Ruby you can run
      `rvm docs generate` to generate the documentation

This is a typical chicken and egg situation. How can I explain the Ruby
help feature, if we are only just getting started with Ruby? So I am
going to jump ahead a little and show you how you can search for
information on the class String:

[source,bash]
----
$ ri String
  [...]
$
----

TIP: Many times it is easier and more informative to use Google instead of ri.

[[irb]]
irb
~~~

`irb` stands for **I**nteractive **R**u**b**y and is a kind of sandbox where
you can play around with Ruby at your leisure. `irb` is launched by
entering `irb` on the shell and ends if you enter `exit`.

An example is worth a thousand words:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
irb(main):001:0> puts 'Hello World!'
Hello World!
=> nil
irb(main):002:0> exit
$
----

NOTE: I the future examples I use `IRB.conf[:PROMPT_MODE] = :SIMPLE` in
      my `.irbrc` config file to generate shorter irb output (without
      the `irb(main):001:0>` part). You can do the
      same by using `irb --simple-prompt`.

[[ruby-is-object-oriented]]
== Ruby is Object-Oriented

Ruby only knows objects. Everything is an object (sounds almost like
Zen). Every object is an instance of a class. You can find out the class
of an object via the method `.class`.

An object in Ruby is encapsulated and can only be reached from the
outside via the methods of the corresponding object. What does this
mean? I cannot change any property of an object directly from the
outside. The corresponding object has to offer a method with which I can
do so.

[NOTE]
====
Please do not panic if you have no idea what a class and an
object is. I won't tell anyone and you can still work with
it just fine without worrying too much. This topic alone could
fill whole volumes. Roughly speaking, an object is a container
for something and a method changes something in that container.

Please go on reading and have a look at the examples. The puzzle
will gradually get clearer.
====

[[methods]]
=== Methods

In other programming languages, the terms you would use for Ruby methods
would be: functions, procedures, subroutines and of course methods.


[NOTE]
====
Here we go with the oversimplification. We can not compare non-Object
oriented programming languages with OO ones. Plus there are two kinds of
methods (class methods and instance methods). I do not
want to make it too complicated. So I simply ignore those "fine"
distinctions.
====

At this point you start looking for a good example, but all I can think
of are silly ones. The problem is the assumption that we are only
allowed to use knowledge that has already been described previously in
this book.

So let's assume that we use the following code sequence repeatedly (for
whatever reason):

[source,ruby]
.hello-worldx3a.rb
----
puts 'Hello World!'
puts 'Hello World!'
puts 'Hello World!'
----

So we want to output the string “Hello World!” three times in separate rows. As
this makes our daily work routine much longer, we are now going to
define a method (with the meaningless name `three\_times`), with which
this can all be done in one go.

IMPORTANT: Names of methods are always written in lower case.

[source,ruby]
.hello-worldx3b.rb
----
def three_times
  puts 'Hello World!'
  puts 'Hello World!'
  puts 'Hello World!'
end
----

Let's test this by starting the `irb` and loading the program with the
command `load './hello-worldx3b.rb'`. After that we have access to the
`three_times` method.

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> load './hello-worldx3b.rb'
=> true
>> three_times
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
=> nil
>> exit
----

When defining a method, you can define required parameters and use them
within the method. This enables us to create a method to which we pass a
string as parameter and we can then output it three times.

[source,ruby]
.hello-worldx3c.rb
----
def three_times(value)
  puts value
  puts value
  puts value
end
----

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> load './hello-worldx3c.rb'
=> true
>> three_times('Hello World!')
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
=> nil
----

Incidentally, you can omit the brackets when calling the method.

[source,bash]
----
>> three_times 'Hello World!'
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
=> nil
----

[TIP]
====
Ruby gurus and would-be gurus are going to turn up their noses on the
subject of “unnecessary” brackets in your programs and will probably
pepper you with more or less stupid comments with comparisons to Java
and other programming languages.

There is one simple rule in the Ruby community: the fewer brackets, the
cooler you are! ;-)

But you won't get a medal for using fewer brackets. Decide for yourself
what makes you happy.
====

If you do not specify a parameter with the above method, you will get
the error message: `wrong number of arguments (0 for 1)`:

[source,bash]
----
>> three_times
ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (given 0, expected 1)
	from /Users/.../hello-worldx3c.rb:1:in `three_times'
	from (irb):2
	from /Users/stefan/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.4.0/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
>> exit
----

You can give the variable `value` a default value and then you can also
call the method without parameter:

[source,ruby]
.hello-worldx3d.rb
----
def three_times(value = 'blue')
  puts value
  puts value
  puts value
end
----

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> load './hello-worldx3d.rb'
=> true
>> three_times('Example')
Example
Example
Example
=> nil
>> three_times
blue
blue
blue
=> nil
>> exit
----

[[classes]]
=== Classes

For now you can think of a class as a collection of methods. The name of
a class always starts with an upper case letter. Let's assume that the
method belongs to the new class `This_and_that`. It would then be
defined as follows in a Ruby program:

[source,ruby]
.hello-worldx3e.rb
----
class This_and_that
  def three_times
    puts 'Hello World!'
    puts 'Hello World!'
    puts 'Hello World!'
  end
end
----

Let's play it through in `irb`:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> load './hello-worldx3e.rb'
=> true
----

Now we try to call the method `three_times`:

[source,bash]
----
>> This_and_that.three_times
NoMethodError: undefined method `three_times' for This_and_that:Class
	from (irb):2
	from /Users/stefan/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.4.0/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
>>
----

This results in an error message, because `This_and_that` is a class
and not an instance. As we are working with instance methods, it only
works if we have first created a new object (a new instance) of the
class `This_and_that` with the class method `new`. Let's name it `abc`:

[source,bash]
----
>> abc = This_and_that.new
=> #<This_and_that:0x007fb01b02dcd0>
>> abc.three_times
Hello World!
Hello World!
Hello World!
=> nil
>> exit
----

I will explain the difference between instance and class methods in more
detail in xref:ruby-basics#class-methods-and-instance-methods[the section called
"Class Methods and Instance Methods"]. Another chicken and egg problem.

[[private-methods]]
==== Private Methods

Quite often it makes sense to only call a method within its own class or
own instance. Such methods are referred to as private methods (as
opposed to public methods), and they are listed below the keyword
`private` within a class.

[source,ruby]
.pm-example.rb
----
class Example
  def a
    puts 'a'
  end

  private
  def b
    puts 'b'
  end
end
----

We run this in an irb. First the public and than the private
method which raises an error:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> load './pm-example.rb'
=> true
>> abc = Example.new
=> #<Example:0x007fa530037910>
>> abc.a
a
=> nil
>> abc.b
NoMethodError: private method `b' called for #<Example:0x007fa530037910>
	from (irb):4
	from /Users/stefan/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.4.0/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
>> exit
----

[[method-initialize]]
==== Method initialize()

If a new instance is created (by calling the method new), the method
that is processed first and automatically is the method `initialize`.
The method is automatically a private method, even if it not listed
explicitly under `private`.

[source,ruby]
.pm-example-a.rb
----
class Room
  def initialize
    puts 'abc'
  end
end
----

irb test of it:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> load './initialize-example-a.rb'
=> true
>> kitchen = Room.new
abc
=> #<Room:0x007f830704edb8>
>> exit
----

The instance `kitchen` is created with `Room.new` and the method
initialize is processed automatically.

The method new accepts the parameters specified for the method
initialize:

[source,ruby]
.initialize-example-b.rb
----
class Example
  def initialize(value)
    puts value
  end
end
----

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> load './initialize-example-b.rb'
=> true
>> abc = Example.new('Hello World!')
Hello World!
=> #<Example:0x007fbb0b845f30>
>> exit
----

[[return]]
==== return

`puts` is nice to demonstrate an example in this book but normally you
need a way to return the result of something. The `return` statement can
be used for that:

[source,ruby]
.circle-a.rb
----
def area_of_a_circle(radius)
  pi = 3.14
  area = pi * radius * radius
  return area
end
----

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> load './circle-a.rb'
=> true
>> area_of_a_circle(10)
=> 314.0
>> exit
----

But it wouldn't be Ruby if you couldn't do it shorter. You can simply
skip return:

[source,ruby]
.circle-b.rb
----
def area_of_a_circle(radius)
  pi = 3.14
  area = pi * radius * radius
  area
end
----

You can actually even skip the last line because Ruby returns the value
of the last expression as a default:

[source,ruby]
.circle-c.rb
----
def area_of_a_circle(radius)
  pi = 3.14
  area = pi * radius * radius
end
----

Obviously you can go one step further with this code:

[source,ruby]
.circle-d.rb
----
def area_of_a_circle(radius)
  pi = 3.14
  pi * radius * radius
end
----

`return` is sometimes useful to make a method easier to read. But you
don't have to use it in case you feel more comfortable with out.

[[inheritance]]
==== Inheritance

A class can inherit from another class. When defining the class, the
parent class must be added with a `<` (smaller than) sign:

[source,ruby]
----
class Example < ParentClass
----

Rails makes use of this approach very frequently (otherwise I would not
be bothering you with it).

In the following example, we define the class `Abc` and which contains
the methods `a`, `b` and `c`. Then we define a class `Abcd` and let it
inherit the class `Abc` and add a new method `d`. The new instances
`example1` and `example2` are created with the Class-Methods `new` and
show that `example2` has access to the methods `a`, `b`, `c` and `d` but
`example1` only to `a`, `b` and `c`.

[source,ruby]
.inheritance-example-a.rb
----
class Abc
  def a
    'a'
  end

  def b
    'b'
  end

  def c
    'c'
  end
end

class Abcd < Abc
  def d
    'd'
  end
end
----

Run in in the irb:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> load './inheritance-example-a.rb'
=> true
>> example1 = Abc.new
=> #<Abc:0x007fac5a845630>
>> example2 = Abcd.new
=> #<Abcd:0x007fac5a836630>
>> example2.d
=> "d"
>> example2.a
=> "a"
>> example1.d
NoMethodError: undefined method `d' for #<Abc:0x007fac5a845630>
	from (irb):6
	from /Users/stefan/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.4.0/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
>> example1.a
=> "a"
>> exit
----

[TIP]
====
It is important to read the Error-Messages. They tell you what happened
and where to search for the problem. In this example Ruby said that
there is an `undefined method` for `#<Abc:0x007fac5a845630>`. With that
information you know that the Class `Abc` is missing the method which
you were trying to use.
====

[[class-methods-and-instance-methods]]
==== Class Methods and Instance Methods

There are two important kinds of methods: class methods and instance
methods.

You now already know what a class it. And an instance of such a class is
created via the class method `new`. A class method can only be called in
connection with the class (for example, the method `new` is a class
method). An instance method is a method that only works with an
instance. So you cannot apply the method `new` to an instance.

Let's first try to call an instance method as class method:

[source,ruby]
.pi-a.rb
----
class Knowledge
  def pi
    3.14
  end
end
----

Run it in irb:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> load 'pi-a.rb'
=> true
>> Knowledge.pi
NoMethodError: undefined method `pi' for Knowledge:Class
	from (irb):2
	from /Users/stefan/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.4.0/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
>>
----

So that does not work. Well, then let's create a new instance of the
class and try again:

[source,bash]
----
>> example = Knowledge.new
=> #<Knowledge:0x007fe620010938>
>> example.pi
=> 3.14
>> exit
----

Now we just need to find out how to define a class method. Hardcore
Rails gurus would now whisk you away into the depths of the source code
and pick out examples from ActiveRecord. I will spare you this and
show an abstract example:

[source,ruby]
.pi-b.rb
----
class Knowledge
  def self.pi
    3.14
  end
end
----

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> load './pi-b.rb'
=> true
>> Knowledge.pi
=> 3.14
>>
----

And the proof to the contrary:

[source,bash]
----
>> example = Knowledge.new
=> #<Knowledge:0x007fa8da045198>
>> example.pi
NoMethodError: undefined method `pi' for #<Knowledge:0x007fa8da045198>
	from (irb):4
	from /Users/stefan/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.4.0/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'
>> exit
----

There are different notations for defining class methods. The two most
common ones are `self.xyz` and `class << self`:

[source,ruby]
----
# Variant 1
# with self.xyz
#
class Knowledge
  def self.pi
    3.14
  end
end
----

[source,ruby]
----
# Variant 2
# with class << self
#
class Knowledge
  class << self
    def pi
      3.14
    end
  end
end
----

The result is always the same.

Of course you can use the same method name for a class and an instance
method. Obviously that doesn't make code easier to read. Here is
an example with `pi` as a class and an instance method:

[source,ruby]
.pi-c.rb
----
class Knowledge
  def pi
    3.14
  end

  def self.pi
    3.14159265359
  end
end
----

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> load './pi-c.rb'
=> true
>> Knowledge.pi
=> 3.14159265359
>> example = Knowledge.new
=> #<Knowledge:0x007f8379846f30>
>> example.pi
=> 3.14
>> exit
----

[[list-of-all-instance-methods]]
==== List of All Instance Methods

You can read out all defined methods for a class with the method
`instance_methods`. We try it out with the class `Knowledge` (first we
create it once again in the irb):

[source,ruby]
.pi-a.rb
----
class Knowledge
  def pi
    3.14
  end
end
----

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> load './pi-a.rb'
=> true
>> Knowledge.instance_methods
=> [:pi, :instance_of?, :kind_of?, :is_a?, :tap, :public_send,
:remove_instance_variable, :singleton_method, :instance_variable_set,
:define_singleton_method, :method, :public_method, :extend, :to_enum,
:enum_for, :<=>, :===, :=~, :!~, :eql?, :respond_to?, :freeze,
:inspect, :object_id, :send, :display, :to_s, :nil?, :hash, :class,
:singleton_class, :clone, :dup, :itself, :taint, :tainted?, :untaint,
:untrust, :untrusted?, :trust, :frozen?, :methods, :singleton_methods,
:protected_methods, :private_methods, :public_methods,
:instance_variable_get, :instance_variables,
:instance_variable_defined?, :!, :==, :!=, :__send__, :equal?,
:instance_eval, :instance_exec, :__id__]
>>
----

But that is much more than we have defined! Why? It's because Ruby gives
every new class a basic set of methods by default. If we only want to
list the methods that we have defined, then we can do it like this:

[source,bash]
----
>> Knowledge.instance_methods(false)
=> [:pi]
>> exit
----

[[basic-classes]]
== Basic Classes

There are many pre defined Classes available in Ruby. For a newbie the probably
most important ones handle numbers and strings.

[[strings]]
=== Strings

Let's experiment a little bit in the `irb`. The method `.class` tells us
which class we are dealing with.

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> "First test"
=> "First test"
>> "First test".class
=> String
----

That was easy. As you can see, Ruby “automagically” creates an object of
the class `String`. We could also do this by explicitly calling the
method `new`:

[source,bash]
----
>> String.new("Second test")
=> "Second test"
>> String.new("Second test").class
=> String
----

If we call `String.new` or `String.new()` without a parameter, this also
creates an object of the class `String`. But it is an empty String:

[source,bash]
----
>> String.new
=> ""
>> String.new.class
=> String
>> exit
----

[[single-and-double-quotations-marks]]
==== Single and Double Quotations Marks

Strings can be defined either in single quotes or double quotes.

There is a special feature for the double quotes: you can integrate
expressions with the construct `#{}`. The result is then automatically
inserted in the corresponding place in the string.

To show this we have to jump ahead and use variables in the example:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> a = "blue"
=> "blue"
>> b = "Color: #{a}"
=> "Color: blue"
>> exit
----

If the result of the expression is not a string, Ruby tries to apply the
method `to_s` in order to convert the value of the object into a string.
Let's try that by integrating an Integer into a String:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> a = 1
=> 1
>> b = "A test: #{a}"
=> "A test: 1"
>> a.class
=> Integer
>> b.class
=> String
>> exit
----

NOTE: If we mention single or double quotation marks in the
      context of strings, we do not mean typographically correct
      curly quotation marks (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark[wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark]), but the ASCII symbols referred to as _apostrophe_ (`'`) or _quotation mark_(`"`).

[[built-in-methods-for-string]]
==== Built-In Methods for String

Most classes already come with a bundle of very useful methods. These
methods are always written after the relevant object, separated by a
point.

Here are a few examples for methods of the class `String`.

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> a = 'A dog'
=> "A dog"
>> a.class
=> String
>> a.size
=> 5
>> a.downcase
=> "a dog"
>> a.upcase
=> "A DOG"
>> a.reverse
=> "god A"
>> exit
----

With `instance_methods(false)` you can get a list of the build in
methods:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> String.instance_methods(false)
=> [:include?, :%, :*, :+, :to_c, :unicode_normalize, :unicode_normalize!,
:unicode_normalized?, :count, :partition, :unpack, :unpack1, :sum, :next,
:casecmp, :casecmp?, :insert, :bytesize, :match, :match?, :succ!, :+@,
:-@, :index, :rindex, :<=>, :replace, :clear, :upto, :getbyte, :==, :===,
:setbyte, :=~, :scrub, :[], :[]=, :chr, :scrub!, :dump, :byteslice,
:upcase, :next!, :empty?, :eql?, :downcase, :capitalize, :swapcase,
:upcase!, :downcase!, :capitalize!, :swapcase!, :hex, :oct, :split,
:lines, :reverse, :chars, :codepoints, :prepend, :bytes, :concat, :<<,
:freeze, :inspect, :intern, :end_with?, :crypt, :ljust, :reverse!, :chop,
:scan, :gsub, :ord, :start_with?, :length, :size, :rstrip, :succ, :center,
:sub, :chomp!, :sub!, :chomp, :rjust, :lstrip!, :gsub!, :chop!, :strip,
:to_str, :to_sym, :rstrip!, :tr, :tr_s, :delete, :to_s, :to_i, :tr_s!,
:delete!, :squeeze!, :each_line, :squeeze, :strip!, :each_codepoint,
:lstrip, :slice!, :rpartition, :each_byte, :each_char, :to_f, :slice,
:ascii_only?, :encoding, :force_encoding, :b, :valid_encoding?, :tr!,
:encode, :encode!, :hash, :to_r]
>> exit
----

[[numbers]]
=== Numbers

[[integers]]
==== Integers

Ruby used to have different types of Integers depending on the length of the
number. With version 2.4 things got easier: We just deal with `Integer`.

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> 23.class
=> Integer
>> 230000000000000000000.class
=> Integer
>> (23*10000).class
=> Integer
>> exit
----

[[floats]]
==== Floats

`Float` is a class for real numbers (“floating point numbers”). The
decimal separator is a point.

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> a = 20.424
=> 20.424
>> a.class
=> Float
>> exit
----

[[mixed-class-calculations]]
==== Mixed Class Calculations

Adding two integers will result in an integer. Adding an integer and a float will result in a float:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> a = 10
=> 10
>> b = 23
=> 23
>> (a + b).class
=> Integer
>> (a + 3.13).class
=> Float
>> exit
----

[[boolean-values-and-nil]]
=== Boolean Values and nil

For boolean values (`true` and `false`) and for `nil` (no value) there
are separate classes:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> true.class
=> TrueClass
>> false.class
=> FalseClass
>> nil.class
=> NilClass
>> exit
----

`nil` (no value) is, by the way, the contraction of the Latin word
_nihil_ (nothing) or, if you look at it in terms of programming history,
the term derives from “_not in list_” from the legacy of the programming
language Lisp (the name is an acronym of _List Processing_).

[[variables]]
== Variables

[[naming-conventions]]
=== Naming Conventions

Normal variables are written in lower case. Please use `snake_case`. Same goes
for symbols and methods.

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> pi = 3.14
=> 3.14
>> exit
----

==== Constants

Constants start with an upper case letter.

WARNING: A constant can also be overwritten with a new value since
         Ruby 2.3 (but you will get a warning message). So please
         do not rely on the constancy of a constant.

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> Pi = 3.14
=> 3.14
>> Pi = 123
(irb):2: warning: already initialized constant Pi
(irb):1: warning: previous definition of Pi was here
=> 123
>> puts Pi
123
=> nil
>> exit
----

You are on the safe side if you are using only ASCII symbols. But with
Ruby 2.4 and the right encoding, you could also use special characters
(for example German Umlaute) more or less without any problems in a
variable name. But if you want to be polite towards other programmers
who probably do not have those characters directly available on their
keyboards, it is better to stick to pure ASCII.


[[scope-of-variables]]
=== Scope of Variables

Variables have a different scope (or “reach”) within the Ruby
application and therefore also within a Ruby on Rails application.

IMPORTANT: You need to keep this scope in mind while programming.
           Otherwise you can end up with odd effects.

[[local-variables-aaa-or-_aaa]]
==== Local Variables (`aaa` or `_aaa`)

Local variables either start with a lower case letter or an underscore
(`_`). Their scope is limited to the current environment (for example
the current method). The following example defines two methods which use
the same local variable radius. Because they are local they don't
interact with each other:

[source,ruby]
.variable-a.rb
----
def area(radius)
  3.14 * radius * radius
end

def circumference(radius)
  2 * 3.14 * radius
end
----

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> load './variable-a.rb'
=> true
>> area(10)
=> 314.0
>> circumference(1)
=> 6.28
>> exit
----

[[global-variables-aaa]]
==== Global Variables (`$aaa`)

A global variable starts with a `$`-sign and is accessible in the entire
programm. Example programm:

[source,ruby]
.variable-b.rb
----
$value = 10

def example
  $value = 20
end

puts $value
example
puts $value
----

[source,bash]
----
$ ruby variable-b.rb
10
20
----

Global variables are used very rarely! You wouldn't harm yourself by
forgetting that they exist right now.

[[instance-variables-aaa]]
==== Instance Variables (`@aaa`)

Instance variables (“*A*ttributes”, hence the `@`) only apply within a
class, but everywhere in it – a mini version of global variables, so to
speak. Unlike global variables, you will find instance variables all
over the place in a Rails application. Let's tackle them in form of an
example program with the name `color.rb`:

[source,ruby]
.color.rb
----
class Wall
  def initialize
    @color = 'white'
  end

  def color
    @color
  end

  def paint_it(value)
    @color = value
  end
end

my_wall = Wall.new
puts my_wall.color

my_wall.paint_it('red')
puts my_wall.color
----

If you start this program, the following output will appear:

[source,bash]
----
$ ruby color.rb
white
red
$
----

In the method `initialize` we set the instance variable `@color` to the
value “white”. The method `paint_it(value)` changes this instance
variable.

With the method `color` we can access the value of `@color` outside of
the instance. This kind of method is called a setter method.

[[methods-once-again]]
== Methods Once Again

In order to keep the amount of chicken and egg problems in this chapter
at a manageable level, we need to go back to the topic Methods and
combine what we have learned so far.

[[method-chaining]]
=== Method Chaining

You may not think of it straight away, but once you have got used to
working with Ruby, then it makes perfect sense (and is perfectly
logical) to chain different methods.

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> a = 'a blue car'
=> "a blue car"
>> a.upcase
=> "A BLUE CAR"
>> a.upcase.reverse
=> "RAC EULB A"
>> exit
----

[[getters-and-setters]]
=== Getters and Setters

As instance variables (“attributes”) only exist
within the relevant instance, you always need to write a “getter” method
for exporting such a variable. If we define a class `Room` that has the
instance variables `@doors` and `@windows` (for the number of doors and
windows in the room), then we can create the getter methods `doors` und
`windows` (example program `room.rb`):

[source,ruby]
.room.rb
----
class Room
  def initialize
    @doors  = 1
    @windows = 1
  end

  def doors
    @doors
  end

  def windows
    @windows
  end
end

kitchen = Room.new

puts "D: #{kitchen.doors}"
puts "W: #{kitchen.windows}"
----

The execution of the program:

[source,bash]
----
$ ruby room.rb
D: 1
W: 1
$
----

As this scenario – wanting to simply return a value in identical form –
is so common, there is already a ready-made getter method for it with
the name `attr_reader`, which you would apply as follows in the program
`room.rb`:

[source,ruby]
.room.rb
----
class Room
  def initialize
    @doors  = 1
    @windows = 1
  end

  attr_reader :doors, :windows
end

kitchen = Room.new

puts "D: #{kitchen.doors}"
puts "W: #{kitchen.windows}"
----

`attr_reader` is a method which is called on the `Room` class. That is
the reason why we use Symbols (e.g. `:doors` and `:windows`) instead of
variables (e.g. `@doors` and `@windows`) as parameter.

NOTE: `attr_reader` is a good example for meta programming in Ruby.
      When working with Rails, you will frequently come across meta
      programming and be grateful for how it works automagically.

If you want to change the number of doors or windows from the outside,
you need a “setter” method. It can be implemented as follows:

[source,ruby]
.room.rb
----
class Room
  def initialize
    @doors  = 1
    @windows = 1
  end

  attr_reader :doors, :windows

  def doors=(value)
    @doors = value
  end

  def windows=(value)
    @windows = value
  end
end

kitchen = Room.new

kitchen.windows = 2

puts "D: #{kitchen.doors}"
puts "W: #{kitchen.windows}"
----

The corresponding output is this:

[source,bash]
----
$ **ruby room.rb**
D: 1
W: 2
$
----

As you can probably imagine, there is of course also a ready-made and
easier way of doing this. Via the setter method `attr_writer` you can
simplify the code of `room.rb` further:

[source,ruby]
.room.rb
----
class Room
  def initialize
    @doors  = 1
    @windows = 1
  end

  attr_reader :doors, :windows
  attr_writer :doors, :windows
end

kitchen = Room.new

kitchen.windows = 2

puts "D: #{kitchen.doors}"
puts "W: #{kitchen.windows}"
----

And (who would have thought!) there is even a method `attr_accessor`
that combines getters and setters. The code for `room.rb` would then
look like this:

[source,ruby]
.room.rb
----
class Room
  def initialize
    @doors  = 1
    @windows = 1
  end

  attr_accessor :doors, :windows
end


kitchen = Room.new

kitchen.windows = 2

puts "D: #{kitchen.doors}"
puts "W: #{kitchen.windows}"
----


[[converting-from-one-to-the-other-casting]]
=== Converting from One to the Other: Casting

There is a whole range of useful instance methods for converting
(“casting”) objects from one class to another. First, let's use the
method `.to_s` to convert a `Fixnum` to a `String`.

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> a = 10
=> 10
>> a.class
=> Integer
>> b = a.to_s
=> "10"
>> b.class
=> String
>> exit
----

NOTE: Incidentally, that is exactly what `puts` does if you use `puts`
      to output a `Fixnum` or a `Float` (for non-strings, it simply
      implicitly adds the method `.to_s` and outputs the result).

Now we use the method `.to_i` to change a `Float` to a `Fixnum`.

[source,bash]
----
irb
>> c = 10.0
=> 10.0
>> c.class
=> Float
>> d = c.to_i
=> 10
>> d.class
=> Integer
>> exit
----

[[method-to_s-for-your-own-classes]]
=== Method `to_s` for Your Own Classes

Integrating a `to_s` method is often useful. Then you can simply
output a corresponding object via `puts` (`puts` automatically outputs
an object via the method `to_s`).

Here is an example:

[source,ruby]
.person-a.rb
----
class Person
  def initialize(first_name, last_name)
    @first_name = first_name
    @last_name = last_name
  end

  def to_s
    "#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
  end
end
----

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> load './person-a.rb'
=> true
>> sw = Person.new('Stefan', 'Wintermeyer')
=> #<Person:0x007fa95d030558 @first_name="Stefan", @last_name="Wintermeyer">
>> puts sw
Stefan Wintermeyer
=> nil
>> exit
----

[[is-a-method]]
=== Is `+` a Method?

Why is there also a plus symbol in the list of methods for String? Let's
find out by looking it up in `ri`:

[source,bash]
----
$ ri -T String.+
String.+

(from ruby site)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  str + other_str   -> new_str

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Concatenation---Returns a new String containing other_str
concatenated to str.

  "Hello from " + self.to_s   #=> "Hello from main"
----

hmmm ... Let's see what it says for `Integer`:

[source,bash]
----
$ ri -T Integer.+
Integer.+

(from ruby site)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  int + numeric  ->  numeric_result

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Performs addition: the class of the resulting object depends on the class of
numeric and on the magnitude of the result. It may return a Bignum.
----

Let's have a go and play around with this in `irb`. So we should be able
to add the `+` to an object, just as any other method, separated by a dot
and add the second number in brackets as parameter:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> 10 + 10
=> 20
>> 10+10
=> 20
>> 10.+10
=> 20
>> 10.+(10)
=> 20
>> exit
----

Aha! The plus symbol is indeed a method, and this method takes the next
value as parameter. Really we should put this value in brackets, but
thanks to Ruby's well thought-out syntax this is not necessary.

[[can-i-overwrite-the-method]]
==== Can I Overwrite the Method `+`?

Yes, you can overwrite any method. Logically, this does not make much
sense for methods such as `+`, unless you want to drive your fellow
programmers mad. I am going to show you a little demo in `irb` so you
will believe me.

The aim is overwriting the method `+` for `Fixnum`. We want the result
of every addition to be the number 42. We write a so call "monkey patch":

[source,ruby]
.monkey-patch-a.rb
----
class Integer
  def +(name, *args, &blk)
    42
  end
end
----

Now we use the `+` method before and after that monkey patch:

[source,bash]
----
irb
>> 10 + 10
=> 20
>> load './monkey-patch-a.rb'
=> true
>> 10 + 10
=> 42
>> exit
----

First we perform a normal addition. Than we redefine the method `+` for
the class `Integer`, and after that we do the calculation again. But this
time, with different results.

[[if-condition]]
== if-Condition

An abstract `if`-condition looks like this:

[source,ruby]
----
if expression
  program
end
----

The program between the expression and `end` is executed if the result
of the expression is not `false` and not `nil`.

[NOTE]
====
You can also use a `then` after the expression:

[source,ruby]
----
if expression then
  program
end
----
====

The construct for a simple `if`-branch in a Ruby program looks like the
following example program:

[source,ruby]
----
a = 10

if a == 10
  puts 'a is 10'
end
----

IMPORTANT: The `==` is used to compare two values.
           Please don't mix it up with the single `=`.

You can test an _expression_ really well in `irb`:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> a = 10
=> 10
>> a == 10
=> true
>> exit
$
----

[[shorthand]]
=== Shorthand

A frequently used shorthand notation of an `if`-condition can be found
in the following code:

[source,ruby]
----
a = 10

# long version
#
if a == 10
  puts 'a is 10'
end

# short version
#
puts 'a is 10' if a == 10
----

[[else]]
=== else

You can probably imagine how this works, but for the sake of
completeness, here is a little example:

[source,ruby]
----
a = 10

if a == 10
  puts 'a is 10'
else
  puts 'a is not 10'
end
----

[[elsif]]
=== elsif

Again, most programmers will know what this is all about. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
a = 10

if a == 10
  puts 'a is 10'
elsif a == 20
  puts 'a is 20'
end
----

[[loops]]
== Loops

There are different ways of implementing loops in Ruby. The iterator
variation is used particularly often in the Rails environment.

[[while-and-until]]
=== while and until

An abstract while loop looks like this:

[source,ruby]
----
while expression do
  program
end
----

[NOTE]
====
The `do` that follows the `expression` is optional. Often you will also
see this:

[source,ruby]
----
while expression
  program
end
----
====

Here is an `irb` example:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> i = 0
=> 0
>> while i < 3 do
?>   puts i
>>   i = i + 1
>> end
0
1
2
=> nil
>> exit
----

`Until` loops are built similarly:

[source,ruby]
----
until expression
  program
ends
----

Again, here is the corresponding `irb` example:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> i = 5
=> 5
>> until i == 0
>>   i = i - 1
>>   puts i
>> end
4
3
2
1
0
=> nil
>> exit
----

[[blocks-and-iterators]]
=== Blocks and Iterators

“Block” and “iterator” are some of the favorite words of many Ruby
programmers. Now I am going to show you why.

In the loop

[source,ruby]
----
5.times { |i| puts i }
----

`i` is the iterator and `puts i` is the block.

You can also express the whole thing in the following syntax:

[source,ruby]
----
5.times do |i|
  puts i
end
----

[[iterators]]
==== Iterators

Iterators are just a specific type of method. As you probably know, the
word “_iterate_” means to repeat something. For example, the class
`Integer` has the iterator `times()`. Let's see what help `ri Integer.times`
offers:

[source,bash]
----
$ ri -T Integer.times
Integer.times

(from ruby site)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  int.times {|i| block }  ->  self
  int.times               ->  an_enumerator

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iterates the given block int times, passing in values from zero to
int - 1.

If no block is given, an Enumerator is returned instead.

  5.times do |i|
    print i, " "
  end
  #=> 0 1 2 3 4
----

And it also gives a nice example that we are going to try out in irb:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> 5.times do |i|
?>   puts i
>> end
0
1
2
3
4
=> 5
>> exit
----

There is also a single-line notation for small blocks:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> 5.times { |i| puts i }
0
1
2
3
4
=> 5
>> exit
----

By the way, an iterator does not necessarily have to pass a variable to
the block:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> 5.times { puts 'example' }
example
example
example
example
example
=> 5
>> exit
----

[[blocks]]
==== Blocks

A block is the code that is triggered by an iterator. In the block, you
have access to the local variable(s) passed by the iterator.

[[method-upto]]
==== Method upto

Apart from `times` there is also the method `upto`, for easily
implementing a loop. `ri` offers a nice example for this, too:

[source,bash]
----
$ ri -T Integer.upto
Integer.upto

(from ruby site)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  int.upto(limit) {|i| block }  ->  self
  int.upto(limit)               ->  an_enumerator

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iterates the given block, passing in integer values from int up to and
including limit.

If no block is given, an Enumerator is returned instead.

For example:

  5.upto(10) { |i| print i, " " }
  #=> 5 6 7 8 9 10
----

[[arrays-and-hashes]]
== Arrays and Hashes

As in many programming languages, _arrays_ and _hashes_ are popular
structures in Ruby for storing data.

[[arrays]]
=== Arrays

An array is a list of objects. Let's play around in `irb:`

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> a = [1,2,3,4,5]
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>> a.class
=> Array
>> exit
----

That is simple and easy to understand.

Let's see if it also works with strings in the array:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> a = ['Test', 'Banana', 'blue']
=> ["Test", "Banana", "blue"]
>> a.class
=> Array
>> a[1]
=> "Banana"
>> a[1].class
=> String
>> exit
----

That also works.

So all that's missing now is an array with a mixture of both. Obviously
that will work, too, because the array stores objects and it does not
matter which kind of objects they are (i.e. `String`, `Integer`, `Float`,
...). But a little test can't hurt:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> a = [1, 2.2, 'House', nil]
=> [1, 2.2, "House", nil]
>> a.class
=> Array
>> a[0]
=> 1
>> a[0].class
=> Integer
>> a[1].class
=> Float
>> a[2].class
=> String
>> a[3].class
=> NilClass
>> exit
----

Arrays can also be created via the method `new` (like
any class). Individual new elements can then be added at the end of an
array via the method `<<`. Here is the corresponding example:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> a = Array.new
=> []
>> a << 'first item'
=> ["first item"]
>> a << 'second item'
=> ["first item", "second item"]
>> exit
----

[[iterator-each]]
==== Iterator `each`

You can work your way through an array piece by piece via the method
`each`. Example:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> cart = ['eggs', 'butter']
=> ["eggs", "butter"]
>> cart.each do |item|
?>   puts item
>> end
eggs
butter
=> ["eggs", "butter"]
>> exit
----

`ri Array.each` provides help and an example in case you forget how to
use `each`.

[[hashes]]
=== Hashes

A _Hash_ is a list of _key/value pairs_. Here is an example with
strings as keys:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> prices = { 'egg' => 0.1, 'butter' => 0.99 }
=> {"egg"=>0.1, "butter"=>0.99}
>> prices['egg']
=> 0.1
>> prices.count
=> 2
>> exit
----

Of course, hashes can store not just strings as objects in the values,
but - as with arrays - also classes that you define yourself (see
xref:ruby-basics#arrays[the section called "Arrays"]).

[[symbols]]
==== Symbols

_Symbols_ are a strange concept and difficult to explain. But they are
very useful and used frequently, amongst others with hashes.

Normally, variables always create new objects:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> a = 'Example 1'
=> "Example 1"
>> a.object_id
=> 70124141350360
>> a = 'Example 2'
=> "Example 2"
>> a.object_id
=> 70124141316700
>> exit
----

In both cases, we have the variable `a`, but object ID is different. We
could carry on in this way indefinitely. Each time, it would generate a
different object ID and therefore a new object. In principle, this is no
big deal and entirely logical in terms of object orientation. But it is
also rather a waste of memory space.

A symbol is defined by a colon before the name and cannot store any
values itself, but it always has the same object ID, so it is very well
suited to be a _key_:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> :a.class
=> Symbol
>> :a.object_id
=> 702428
>> exit
----

Let's do another little experiment to make the difference clearer. We
use a string object with the content “`white`” three times in a row and
then the symbol `:white` three times in a row. For `"white"`, a new
object is created each time. For the symbol `:white`, only the first
time:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> 'white'.object_id
=> 70342874305700
>> 'white'.object_id
=> 70342874300640
>> 'white'.object_id
=> 70342874271720
>> :white.object_id
=> 1088668
>> :white.object_id
=> 1088668
>> :white.object_id
=> 1088668
>> exit
----

Using symbols as key for hashes is much more memory efficient:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> colors = { black: '#000000', white: '#FFFFFF' }
=> {:black=>"#000000", :white=>"#FFFFFF"}
>> puts colors[:white]
#FFFFFF
=> nil
>> exit
----

You will frequently see symbols in Rails. If you want to find out more
about symbols, go to the help page about the class Symbol via
`ri Symbol`.

[[iterator-each-1]]
==== Iterator each

With the method `each` you can work your way through a `Hash` step by
step. Example:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> colors = {black: '#000000', white: '#FFFFFF' }
=> {:black=>"#000000", :white=>"#FFFFFF"}
>> colors.each do |key, value|
?>   puts "#{key} #{value}"
>> end
black #000000
white #FFFFFF
=> {:black=>"#000000", :white=>"#FFFFFF"}
>> exit
----

Again, `ri Hash.each` offers help and an example, in case you cannot remember one
day how to use each.

[[range]]
== Range

The class Range represents an interval. The start and end points of the
interval are defined enclosed in normal brackets and separated by two
dots in between them. Here is an example in which we use a range like an
iterator with each:

[source,bash]
----
$ irb
>> (0..3)
=> 0..3
>> (0..3).class
=> Range
>> (0..3).each do |i|
?>   puts i
>> end
0
1
2
3
=> 0..3
>>
----

Via the method `to_a` you can generate an array from a `Range`:

[source,bash]
----
>> (0..3).to_a
=> [0, 1, 2, 3]
>>
----

A range can be generated from objects of any type. Important is only
that the objects can be compared via `<=>` and use the method `succ` for
counting on to the next value. So you can also use `Range` to represent
letters:

[source,bash]

As alternative notation, you may sometimes come across `Range.new()`. In
this case, the start and end points are not separated by two dots, but
by a comma. This is what it looks like:

[source,bash]

>> (0..3) == Range.new(0,3)
=> true
>> exit
