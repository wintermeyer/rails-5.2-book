[[caching]]
= Caching

Where caching of web applications is concerned, most people tend to wait until
they encounter performance problems. Then the admin first looks at the database
and adds an index here and there. If that does not help, he has a look at the
views and adds fragment caching. But this is not the best approach for working
with caches. The aim of this chapter is to help you understand how key based
cache expiration works. You can then use this approach to plan new applications
already on the database structure level in such a way that you can cache
optimally during development.

There are two main arguments for using caching:

* The application becomes faster for the user. A faster web page results
in happier users which results in a better conversion rate.
* You need less hardware for the web server, because you require less
resources for processing the queries.

NOTE: If these two arguments are irrelevant for you, then you don't
      need to read this chapter.

We are going to look at three different caching methods:

* HTTP caching
+
This is the sledge hammer among the caching methods and the ultimate
performance weapon. In particular, web pages that are intended for
mobile devices should try to make the most of HTTP
caching. If you use a combination of key based cache expiration and HTTP
caching, you save a huge amount of processing time on the server and
also bandwidth.
* Page caching
+
This is the screwdriver among the caching methods. You can get a lot of
performance out of the system, but it is not as good as HTTP caching.
* Fragment caching
+
The tweezers among the caching methods, so to speak. But don’t
underestimate it.

TIP: The aim is to optimally combine all three methods.

[[the-example-application]]
== The Example Application

We are going to use a simple phone book with a model for the `company`
and a model for the `employees` of the `company`.

We create the new Rails app:

[source,bash]
----
$ rails new phone_book
  [...]
$ cd phone_book
$ rails generate scaffold company name
  [...]
$ rails generate scaffold employee company:references \
  last_name first_name phone_number
  [...]
$ rails db:migrate
  [...]
----

[[models]]
=== Models

The setup for our two models:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/company.rb
----
class Company < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name,
            presence: true,
            uniqueness: true

  has_many :employees, dependent: :destroy

  def to_s
    name
  end
end
----

[source,ruby]
.app/models/employee.rb
----
class Employee < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :company, touch: true

  validates :first_name,
            presence: true

  validates :last_name,
            presence: true

  validates :company,
            presence: true

  def to_s
    "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
  end
end
----

[[views]]
=== Views

We change the following two company views to list the number of
employees in the Index view and all the employees in the Show view.

[source,erb]
.app/views/companies/index.html.erb
----
[...]
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Number of employees</th>
      <th colspan="3"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <% @companies.each do |company| %>
      <tr>
        <td><%= company.name %></td>
        <td><%= company.employees.count %></td>
        [...]
      </tr>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>
[...]
----

[source,erb]
.app/views/companies/show.html.erb
----
<p id="notice"><%= notice %></p>

<p>
  <strong>Name:</strong>
  <%= @company.name %>
</p>

<% if @company.employees.any? %>
<h1>Employees</h1>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Last name</th>
      <th>First name</th>
      <th>Phone number</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <% @company.employees.each do |employee| %>
      <tr>
        <td><%= employee.last_name %></td>
        <td><%= employee.first_name %></td>
        <td><%= employee.phone_number %></td>
      </tr>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>
<% end %>

<%= link_to 'Edit', edit_company_path(@company) %> |
<%= link_to 'Back', companies_path %>
----

[[example-data]]
=== Example Data

To easily populate the database, we use the Faker gem (see
http://faker.rubyforge.org/). With Faker, you can generate random names
and phone numbers. Please add the following line in the `Gemfile`:

[source,ruby]
.Gemfile
----
gem 'faker'
----

Then start `bundle`:

[source,bash]
----
$ bundle
----

With the `db/seeds.rb` we create 30 companies with a random number of
employees in each case:

[source,ruby]
.db/seeds.rb
----
30.times do
  company = Company.new(:name => Faker::Company.name)
  if company.save
    SecureRandom.random_number(100).times do
      company.employees.create(
        first_name:   Faker::Name.first_name,
        last_name:    Faker::Name.last_name,
        phone_number: Faker::PhoneNumber.phone_number
      )
    end
  end
end
----

We populate it via `rails db:seed`

[source,bash]
----
$ rails db:seed
----

You can start the application with `rails server` and retrieve the
example data with a web browser by going to the URLs
http://localhost:3000/companies or http://localhost:3000/companies/1

[[normal-speed-of-the-pages-to-optimize]]
=== Normal Speed of the Pages to Optimize

In this chapter, we optimize the following web pages. Start the Rails
application in development mode with `rails server`. The relevant
numbers of course depend on the hardware you are using.

[source,bash]
----
$ rails server
----

To access the web pages, we use the command line tool curl
(http://curl.haxx.se/). Of course you can also access the web pages with
other web browsers. We look at the time shown in the Rails log for
creating the page. In reality, you need to add the time it takes for the
page to be delivered to the web browser.

[[list-of-all-companies-index-view]]
==== List of All Companies (Index View)

At the URL http://localhost:3000/companies the user can see a list of
all saved companies with the relevant number of employees.

Generating the page takes 89ms.

[source,bash]
----
Completed 200 OK in 89ms (Views: 79.0ms | ActiveRecord: 9.6ms)
----

[[detailled-view-of-a-single-company-show-view]]
==== Detailed View of a Single Company (Show View)

At the URL http://localhost:3000/companies/1 the user can see the
details of the first company with all employees.

Generating the page takes 51ms.

[source,bash]
----
Completed 200 OK in 51ms (Views: 48.9ms | ActiveRecord: 0.9ms)
----

[[http-caching]]
== HTTP Caching

HTTP caching attempts to reuse already loaded web pages or files. For
example, if you visit a web page such as http://www.nytimes.com or
http://www.wired.com several times a day to read the latest news, then
certain elements of that page (for example, the logo image at the top of
the page) will not be loaded again on your second visit. Your browser
already has these files in the local cache, which saves loading time and
bandwidth.

Within the Rails framework, our aim is answering the question "Has a
page changed?" already in the controller. Because normally, most of the
time is spent on rendering the page in the view. I’d like to repeat
that: Most of the time is spent on rendering the page in the view!

[[last-modified]]
=== Last-Modified

The web browser knows when it has downloaded a resource (e.g. a web page)
and then placed it into it's cache. At a second request it can pass this
information to the web server in an
`If-Modified-Since:` header. The web server can then compare this
information to the corresponding file and either deliver a newer version
or return an `HTTP 304 Not Modified` code as response. In case of a 304,
the web browser delivers the cached version. Now you are going to say,
"That’s all very well for images, but it won’t help me at all for
dynamically generated web pages such as the Index view of the
companies." But you are underestimating the power of Rails.

NOTE: Please modify the times used in the examples in accordance with
      your own circumstances.

Please edit the `show` method in the controller file
`app/controllers/companies_controller.rb` as follows :

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/companies_controller.rb
----
# GET /companies/1
# GET /companies/1.json
def show
  fresh_when last_modified: @company.updated_at
end
----

After restarting the Rails application, we have a look at the HTTP
header of http://localhost:3000/companies/1:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -I http://localhost:3000/companies/1
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Last-Modified: Sun, 03 May 2015 18:38:05 GMT
[...]
----

The `Last-Modified` entry in the HTTP header was generated by
`fresh_when` in the controller. If we later go to the same web page and
specify this time as well, then we do not get the web page back, but a
`304 Not Modified` message:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -I http://localhost:3000/companies/1 --header 'If-Modified-Since: Sun,
03 May 2015 18:38:05 GMT'
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
 [...]
----

In the Rails log, we find this:

[source,bash]
----
Started HEAD "/companies/1" for 127.0.0.1 at 2015-05-03 20:51:02 +0200
Processing by CompaniesController#show as */*
  Parameters: {"id"=>"1"}
  Company Load (0.1ms)  SELECT  "companies".* FROM "companies" WHERE
  "companies"."id" = ? LIMIT 1  [["id", 1]]
Completed 304 Not Modified in 2ms (ActiveRecord: 0.1ms)
----

Rails took 2ms to answer this request, compared to the 51ms of the
standard variation. This is much faster! So you have used less resources
on the server. And saved a massive amount of bandwidth. The user will be
able to see the page much more quickly.

[[etag]]
=== Etag

Sometimes the `update_at` field of a particular object is not meaningful on its
own. For example, if you have a web page where users can log in and this page
then generates web page contents based on a role model, it can happen that user
A as admin is able to see an Edit link that is not displayed to user B as normal
user. In such a scenario, the Last-Modified header explained in section
xref:caching#last-modified["Last Modified"] does not help.

In these cases, we can use the etag header. The etag is generated by the
web server and delivered when the web page is first visited. If the user
visits the same URL again, the browser can then check if the
corresponding web page has changed by sending a `If-None-Match:` query
to the web server.

Please edit the `index` and `show` methods in the controller file
`app/controllers/companies_controller.rb` as follows:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/companies_controller.rb
----
# GET /companies
# GET /companies.json
def index
  @companies = Company.all
  fresh_when etag: @companies
end

# GET /companies/1
# GET /companies/1.json
def show
  fresh_when etag: @company
end
----

A special Rails feature comes into play for the etag: Rails
automatically sets a new CSRF token for each new visitor of the website.
This prevents cross-site request forgery attacks (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_site_request_forgery[wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_site_request_forgery]).
But it also means that each new user of a web page gets a new etag for
the same page. To ensure that the same users also get identical CSRF
tokens, these are stored in a cookie by the web browser and consequently
sent back to the web server every time the web page is visited. The curl
we used for developing does not do this by default. But we can tell curl
that we want to save all cookies in a file and transmit these cookies
later if a request is received.

For saving, we use the `-c cookies.txt` parameter.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -I http://localhost:3000/companies -c cookies.txt
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Etag: "a8a30e6dcdb4380f169dd18911cd6a51"
  [...]
----

With the parameter `-b cookies.txt`, curl sends these cookies to the web
server when a request arrives. Now we get the same etag for two
subsequent requests:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -I http://localhost:3000/companies -b cookies.txt
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Etag: "a8a30e6dcdb4380f169dd18911cd6a51"
[...]

$ curl -I http://localhost:3000/companies -b cookies.txt
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Etag: "a8a30e6dcdb4380f169dd18911cd6a51"
[...]

----

We now use this etag to find out in the request with `If-None-Match` if
the version we have cached is still up to date:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -I http://localhost:3000/companies -b cookies.txt --header
'If-None-Match: "a8a30e6dcdb4380f169dd18911cd6a51"'
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Etag: "a8a30e6dcdb4380f169dd18911cd6a51"
[...]
----

We get a `304 Not Modified` in response. Let’s look at the Rails log:

[source,bash]
----
Started HEAD "/companies" for 127.0.0.1 at 2015-05-03 21:00:01 +0200
Processing by CompaniesController#index as */*
  Cache digest for app/views/companies/index.html.erb:
  5365a42330adb48b855f7488b0d25b29
  Company Load (0.2ms)  SELECT "companies".* FROM "companies"
Completed 304 Not Modified in 5ms (ActiveRecord: 0.2ms)
----

Rails only took 5ms to process the request. Almost 10 times as fast as
the variation without cache! Plus we have saved bandwidth again. The
user will be happy with the speedy web application.

[[current_user-and-other-potential-parameters]]
==== current_user and Other Potential Parameters

As basis for generating an etag, we can not just pass an object, but
also an array of objects. This way, we can solve the problem with the
logged-in user. Let’s assume that a logged-in user is output with the
method `current_user`.

We only have to add `etag { current_user.try :id }` in the
`app/controllers/application_controller.rb` to make sure that all etags
in the application include the `current_user.id` which is `nil` in case
nobody is logged in.

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/application_controller.rb
----
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  # Prevent CSRF attacks by raising an exception.
  # For APIs, you may want to use :null_session instead.
  protect_from_forgery with: :exception

  etag { current_user.try :id }
end
----

You can chain other objects in this array too and use this approach to
define when a page has not changed.

[[the-magic-of-touch]]
=== The Magic of touch

What happens if an Employee is edited or deleted? Then the show view and
potentially also the index view would have to change as well. That is
the reason for the line

[source,ruby]
----
belongs_to :company, touch: true
----

in the `employee` model. Every time an object of the class `Employee` is
saved in edited form, and if `touch: true` is used, ActiveRecord updates
the superordinate Company element in the database. The `updated_at`
field is set to the current time. It is "touched".

This approach ensures that a correct content is delivered.

[[stale]]
=== stale?

Up to now, we have always assumed that only HTML pages are delivered. So
we were able to use `fresh_when` and then do without the
`respond_to do |format|` block. But HTTP caching is not limited to HTML
pages. Yet if we render JSON (for example) as well and want to deliver
it via HTTP caching, we need to use the method stale?. Using stale?
resembles using the method `fresh_when`. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
def show
  if stale? @company
    respond_to do |format|
      format.html
      format.json { render json: @company }
    end
  end
end
----

[[using-proxies-public]]
=== Using Proxies (public)

Up to now, we always assumed that we are using a cache on the web
browser. But on the Internet, there are many proxies that are often
closer to the user and can therefore useful for caching in case of
non-personalized pages. If our example was a publicly accessible phone
book, then we could activate the free services of the proxies with the
parameter `public: true` in `fresh_when` or stale?.

Example:

[source,ruby]
----
# GET /companies/1
# GET /companies/1.json
def show
  fresh_when @company, public: true
end
----

We go to the web page and get the output:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -I http://localhost:3000/companies/1
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Etag: "915880f20b5c0c57aa6d0c955910b009"
Last-Modified: Sun, 03 May 2015 18:38:05 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Cache-Control: public
[...]
----

The header `Cache-Control: public` tells all proxies that they can also
cache this web page.

[WARNING]
====
Using proxies always has to be done with great caution. On the one hand,
they are brilliantly suited for delivering your own web page quickly to
more users, but on the other, you have to be absolutely sure that no
personalized pages are cached on public proxies. For example, CSRF tags
and Flash messages should never end up in a public proxy. To be sure
with the CSRF tags, it is a good idea to make the output of
`csrf_meta_tag` in the default `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`
layout dependent on the question whether the page may be cached publicly
or not:

[source,erb]
----
<%= csrf_meta_tag unless response.cache_control[:public] %>
----
====

[[cache-control-with-time-limit]]
=== Cache-Control With Time Limit

When using `Etag` and `Last-Modified` we assume that the web browser definitely checks once more with
the web server if the cached version of a web page is still current.
This is a very safe approach.

But you can take the optimization one step further by predicting the
future: if I am already sure when delivering the web page that this web
page is not going to change in the next two minutes, hours or days, then
I can tell the web browser this directly. It then does not need to check
back again within this specified period of time. This overhead saving
has advantages, especially with mobile web browsers with relatively high
latency. Plus you also save server load on the web server.

In the output of the HTTP header, you may already have noticed the
corresponding line in the `Etag` and `Last-Modified` examples:

[source,bash]
----
Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate
----

The item `must-revalidate` tells the web browser that it should
definitely check back with the web server to see if a web page has
changed in the meantime. The second parameter `private` means that only
the web browser is allowed to cache this page. Any proxies on the way
are not permitted to cache this page.

If we decide for our phone book that the web page is going to stay
unchanged for at least 2 minutes, then we can expand the code example by
adding the method `expires_in`. The controller
`app/controllers/companies.rb` would then contain the following code for
the method show:

[source,ruby]
----
# GET /companies/1
# GET /companies/1.json
def show
  expires_in 2.minutes
  fresh_when @company, public: true
end
----

Now we get a different cache control information in response to a
request:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -I http://localhost:3000/companies/1
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Date: Sun, 03 May 2015 19:13:20 GMT
Etag: "915880f20b5c0c57aa6d0c955910b009"
Last-Modified: Sun, 03 May 2015 18:38:05 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Cache-Control: max-age=120, public
[...]
----

The two minutes are specified in seconds (`max-age=120`) and we no
longer need `must-revalidate`. So in the next 120 seconds, the web
browser does not need to check back with the web server to see if the
content of this page has changed.

[NOTE]
====
This mechanism is also used by the asset pipeline. Assets created there
in the production environment can be identified clearly by the checksum
in the file name and can be cached for a very long time both in the web
browser and in public proxies. That’s why we have the following section
in the nginx configuration file:

[source,config]
----
location ^~ /assets/ {
  gzip_static on;
  expires max;
  add_header Cache-Control public;
}
----
====

[[fragment-caching]]
== Fragment Caching

With fragment caching you can cache individual parts of a view. You can
safely use it in combination with xref:caching#http-caching[
HTTP-Caching] and xref:caching#page-caching[Page Caching]. The
advantages once again are a reduction of server load and faster web page
generation, which means increased usability.

Please install a new example application (see
xref:caching#a-simple-example-application["A Simple Example
Application"]).

[[enabling-fragment-caching-in-development-mode]]
=== Enabling Fragment Caching in Development Mode

Fragement caching is by default disabled in the development
environment. We have to activate it by creating the file
`tmp/caching-dev.txt`:

[source,bash]
----
$ touch tmp/caching-dev.txt
----

NOTE: In production mode, fragment caching is enabled by default.

[[caching-table-of-index-view]]
=== Caching Table of Index View

On the page http://localhost:3000/companies, a very computationally
intensive table with all companies is rendered. We can cache this table
as a whole. To do so, we need to enclose the table in a
`<% cache('name_of_cache') do %> ... <% end %>` block:

[source,erb]
----
<% cache('name_of_cache') do %>

[...]

<% end %>
----

Please edit the file `app/views/companies/index.html.erb` as follows:

[source,erb]
.app/views/companies/index.html.erb
----
<h1>Companies</h1>

<% cache('table_of_all_companies') do %>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Number of employees</th>
      <th colspan="3"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <% @companies.each do |company| %>
      <tr>
        <td><%= company.name %></td>
        <td><%= company.employees.count %></td>
        <td><%= link_to 'Show', company %></td>
        <td><%= link_to 'Edit', edit_company_path(company) %></td>
        <td><%= link_to 'Destroy', company, method: :delete, data: { confirm:
        'Are you sure?' } %></td>
      </tr>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>
<% end %>

<br />

<%= link_to 'New Company', new_company_path %>
----

Then you can start the Rails server with `rails server` and go to the
URL http://localhost:3000/companies.

The first time a page which has a fragment cache is a little bit slower
because the cache has to be written. The second time it is a lot of faster.

[[deleting-fragment-cache]]
=== Deleting Fragment Cache

With the method `expire_fragment` you can clear specific fragment caches.
Basically, we can build this idea into the model in the same way as shown in the
section xref:caching#deleting-page-caches-automatically["Deleting Page Caches
Automatically"].

The model file `app/models/company.rb` would then look like this:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/company.rb
----
class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :name,
            presence: true,
            uniqueness: true

  has_many :employees, dependent: :destroy

  after_create   :expire_cache
  after_update   :expire_cache
  before_destroy :expire_cache

  def to_s
    name
  end

  def expire_cache
    ActionController::Base.new.expire_fragment('table_of_all_companies')
  end
end
----

As the number of employees also has an effect on this table, we would
also have to expand the file `app/models/employees.rb` accordingly:

[source,ruby]
.app/models/employees.rb
----
class Employee < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :company, touch: true

  validates :first_name,
            presence: true

  validates :last_name,
            presence: true

  validates :company,
            presence: true

  after_create   :expire_cache
  after_update   :expire_cache
  before_destroy :expire_cache

  def to_s
    "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
  end

  def expire_cache
    ActionController::Base.new.expire_fragment('table_of_all_companies')
  end
end
----

Deleting specific fragment caches often involves a lot of effort in
terms of programming. One, you often miss things and two, in big
projects it’s not easy to keep track of all the different cache names.
Often it is easier to automatically create names via the method
`cache_key`. These then expire automatically in the cache.

[[auto-expiring-caches]]
=== Auto-Expiring Caches

Managing fragment caching is rather complex with the naming convention used in
the section xref:caching#caching-table-of-index-view["Caching Table of Index
View"]. On the one hand, you can be sure that the cache does not have any
superfluous ballast if you have programmed neatly, but on the other, it does not
really matter. A cache is structured in such a way that it deletes old and no
longer required elements on its own. If we use a mechanism that gives a fragment
cache a unique name, as in the xref:asset-pipeline[asset pipeline], then we
would not need to go to all the trouble of deleting fragment caches.

That is precisely what the method `cache_key` is for. `cache_key` gives
you a unique name for an element. Let’s try it in the console. First, we
get the always identical `cache_key` of the first company item two times
in a row ("companies/1-20150503192915968370000"), then we touch the
item (a touch sets the attribute `updated_at` to the current time) and
finally we output the new `cache_key`
("companies/1-20150503192915968370000"):

[source,bash]
----
$ rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 40524

  "companies"."id" ASC LIMIT 1

>> exit
----

Let’s use this knowledge to edit the index view in the file
`app/views/companies/index.html.erb`:

[source,erb]
.app/views/companies/index.html.erb
----
<h1>Companies</h1>

<% cache(@companies) do %>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Number of employees</th>
      <th colspan="3"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <% @companies.each do |company| %>
      <tr>
        <td><%= company.name %></td>
        <td><%= company.employees.count %></td>
        <td><%= link_to 'Show', company %></td>
        <td><%= link_to 'Edit', edit_company_path(company) %></td>
        <td><%= link_to 'Destroy', company, method: :delete, data: { confirm:
        'Are you sure?' } %></td>
      </tr>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>
<% end %>

<br />

<%= link_to 'New Company', new_company_path %>
----

Here, we not only use a fragment cache for the whole table, but also one
for each line. So the initial call will take longer than before. But if
any individual companies change, only one line has to be re-rendered in
each case.

NOTE: There is no general answer to the question in how much detail you should
      use fragment caching. Just go ahead and experiment with it, then look in
      the log to see how long things take.

[[change-code-in-the-view-results-in-an-expired-cache]]
==== Change Code in the View results in an expired Cache

Rails tracks an MD5 sum of the view you use. So if you change the file
(e.g. `app/views/companies/index.html.erb`) the MD5 changes and all old
caches will expire.

[[cache-store]]
=== Cache Store

The cache store manages the stored fragment caches. If not configured
otherwise, this is the Rails MemoryStore. This cache store is good for
developing, but less suitable for a production system because it acts
independently for each Ruby on Rails process. So if you have several
Ruby on Rails processes running in parallel in the production system,
each process holds its own MemoryStore.

[[memcachestore]]
==== MemCacheStore

Most production systems use memcached (http://memcached.org/) as cache
store. To enable memcached as cache store in the production system, you
need to add the following line in the file
`config/environments/production.rb`:

[source,ruby]
.config/environments/production.rb
----
config.cache_store = :mem_cache_store
----

The combination of appropriately used auto-expiring caches and memcached
is an excellent recipe for a successful web page.

[[other-cache-stores]]
==== Other Cache Stores

In the official Rails documentation you will find a list of other cache
stores at
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#cache-stores.

[[page-caching]]
== Page Caching

Page Caching is extrem and was removed from the core of Rails 4.0. But
it is still available as a gem.

IMPORTANT: To do this you need a bit of knowledge to configure your Webserver
           (e.g. Nginx or Apache).

With page caching, it’s all about placing a complete HTML page (in other
words, the render result of a view) into a subdirectory of the `public`
directory and to have it delivered directly from there by the web server
(for example Nginx) whenever the web page is visited next. Additionally,
you can also save a compressed gz version of the HTML page there. A
production web server will automatically deliver files below `public`
itself and can also be configured so that any gz files present are
delivered directly.

In complex views that may take 500ms or even more for rendering, the
amount of time you save is of course considerable. As web page operator,
you once more save valuable server resources and can service more
visitors with the same hardware. The web page user profits from a faster
delivery of the web page.

[WARNING]
====
When programming your Rails application, please ensure that you also
update this page itself, or delete it! You will find a description in
the section xref:caching#deleting-page-caches-automatically["Deleting
Page Caches Automatically"]. Otherwise, you end up with an outdated
cache later.

Please also ensure that page caching rejects all URL parameters by
default. For example, if you try to go to
http://localhost:3000/companies?search=abc this automatically becomes
http://localhost:3000/companies. But that can easily be fixed with a
better route logic.
====

Please install a fresh example application (see section
xref:caching#a-simple-example-application["A Simple Example
Application"]) and add the gem with the following line in Gemfile.

[source,config]
----
gem 'actionpack-page_caching'
----

Now install it with the command `bundle install`.

[source,bash]
----
$ bundle install
[...]
----

Lastly you have to tell Rails where to store the cache files. Please add
the following line in your `config/application.rb` file:

[source,ruby]
.config/application.rb
----
config.action_controller.page_cache_directory =
"#{Rails.root.to_s}/public/deploy"
----

[[activating-page-caching-in-development-mode]]
=== Activating Page Caching in Development Mode

First we need to go to the file `config/environments/development.rb` and
set the item `config.action_controller.perform_caching` to `true`:

[source,ruby]
.config/environments/development.rb
----
config.action_controller.perform_caching = true
----

Otherwise, we cannot try the page caching in development mode. In
production mode, page caching is enabled by default.

[[configure-our-webserver]]
=== Configure our Webserver

Know you have to tell your webserver (e.g. Nginx or Apache) that it
should check the `/public/deploy` directory first before hitting the
Rails application. You have to configure too, that it will deliver a gz
file if one is available.

There is no one perfect way of doing it. You have to find the best way
of doing it in your environment by youself.

[TIP]
====

As a quick and dirty hack for development you can set the
`page_cache_directory` to public. Than your development system will
deliver the cached page.

[source,ruby]
----
config.action_controller.page_cache_directory =
"#{Rails.root.to_s}/public"
----
====

[[caching-company-index-and-show-view]]
=== Caching Company Index and Show View

Enabling page caching happens in the controller. If we want to cache the
show view for Company, we need to go to the controller
`app/controllers/companies_controller.rb` and enter the command
`caches_page :show` at the top:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/companies_controller.rb
----
class CompaniesController < ApplicationController
  caches_page :show

[...]
----

Before starting the application, the `public` directory looks like this:

[source,bash]
----
public/
├── 404.html
├── 422.html
├── 500.html
├── apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png
├── apple-touch-icon.png
├── favicon.ico
└── robots.txt
----

After starting the appliation with `rails server` and going to the URLs
http://localhost:3000/companies and http://localhost:3000/companies/1
via a web browser, it looks like this:

[source,bash]
----
public
├── 404.html
├── 422.html
├── 500.html
├── apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png
├── apple-touch-icon.png
├── deploy
│   └── companies
│       └── 1.html
├── favicon.ico
└── robots.txt
----

The file `public/deploy/companies/1.html` has been created by page
caching.

From now on, the web server will only deliver the cached versions when
these pages are accessed.

[[gz-versions]]
==== gz Versions

If you use page cache, you should also cache directly zipped gz files.
You can do this via the option `:gzip => true` or use a specific
compression parameter as symbol instead of `true` (for example
`:best_compression`).

The controller `app/controllers/companies_controller.rb` would then look
like this at the beginning:

[source,ruby]
.app/controllers/companies_controller.rb
----
class CompaniesController < ApplicationController
  caches_page :show, gzip: true

[...]
----

This automatically saves a compressed and an uncompressed version of
each page cache:

[source,bash]
----
public
├── 404.html
├── 422.html
├── 500.html
├── apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png
├── apple-touch-icon.png
├── deploy
│   └── companies
│       ├── 1.html
│       └── 1.html.gz
├── favicon.ico
└── robots.txt
----

[[the-file-extension-.html]]
==== The File Extension .html

Rails saves the page accessed at http://localhost:3000/companies under
the file name `companies.html`. So the upstream web server will find and
deliver this file if you go to http://localhost:3000/companies.html, but
not if you try to go to http://localhost:3000/companies, because the
extension `.html` at the end of the URI is missing.

If you are using the Nginx server the easiest way is adapting the `try_files`
instruction in the Nginx configuration file as follows:

[source,config]
----
try_files $uri/index.html $uri $uri.html @unicorn;
----

Nginx then checks if a file with the extension `.html` of the currently
accessed URI exists.

[[deleting-page-caches-automatically]]
=== Deleting Page Caches Automatically

As soon as the data used in the view changes, the saved cache files have
to be deleted. Otherwise, the cache would no longer be up to date.

According to the official Rails documentation, the solution for this
problem is the class ActionController::Caching::Sweeper. But this
approach, described at
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html#sweepers, has a
big disadvantage: it is limited to actions that happen within the
controller. So if an action is triggered via URL by the web browser, the
corresponding cache is also changed or deleted. But if an object is
deleted in the console, for example, the sweeper would not realize this.
For that reason, I am going to show you an approach that does not use a
sweeper, but works directly in the model with ActiveRecord callbacks.

In our phone book application, we always need to delete the cache for
http://localhost:3000/companies and
http://localhost:3000/companies/company_id when editing a company. When
editing an employee, we also have to delete the corresponding cache for
the relevant employee.

[[models-1]]
==== Models

Now we still need to fix the models so that the corresponding caches are
deleted automatically as soon as an object is created, edited or
deleted.

[source,ruby]
.app/models/company.rb
----
class Company < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :name,
            presence: true,
            uniqueness: true

  has_many :employees, dependent: :destroy

  after_create   :expire_cache
  after_update   :expire_cache
  before_destroy :expire_cache

  def to_s
    name
  end

  def expire_cache
    ActionController::Base.expire_page(Rails.application.routes.url_helpers.company_path(self))
    ActionController::Base.expire_page(Rails.application.routes.url_helpers.companies_path)
  end

end
----

[source,ruby]
.app/models/employee.rb
----
class Employee < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :company, touch: true

  validates :first_name,
            presence: true

  validates :last_name,
            presence: true

  validates :company,
            presence: true

  after_create   :expire_cache
  after_update   :expire_cache
  before_destroy :expire_cache

  def to_s
    "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
  end

  def expire_cache
    ActionController::Base.expire_page(Rails.application.routes.url_helpers.employee_path(self))
    ActionController::Base.expire_page(Rails.application.routes.url_helpers.employees_path)
    self.company.expire_cache
  end

end
----

[[preheating]]
== Preheating

Now that you have read your way through the caching chapter, here is a
final tip: preheat your cache!

For example, if you have a web application in a company and you know
that at 9 o’clock in the morning, all employees are going to log in and
then access this web application, then it’s a good idea to let your web
server go through all those views a few hours in advance with cron-job.
At night, your server is probably bored anyway.

Check out the behavior patterns of your users. With public web pages,
this can be done for example via Google Analytics
(http://www.google.com/analytics/). You will find that at certain times
of the day, there is a lot more traffic going in. If you have a quiet
phase prior to this, you can use it to warm up your cache.

The purpose of preheating is once more saving server ressources and
achieving better quality for the user, as the web page is displayed more
quickly.
